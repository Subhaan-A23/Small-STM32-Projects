This repository contains small STM32 projects that I do, these small projects are done in
order to learn new things about the STM32 including some of its basic features and how they
can be used.

The projects in this repository are not designed to be useful or meaningful in any way,
rather they are there to show an application of some STM32 feauture, such as an ADC or DAC etc.

The completed projects with a small description are shown below:

1.Controlling an LED with a potentiometer
    -A potentiometer is connected to the STM32's ADC and the LED is connected to the 
    STM32's DAC. The potentiometer is used to control the LED's brightness
