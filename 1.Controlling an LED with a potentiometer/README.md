1.Controlling an LED with a potentiometer

Description:
  -An LED is connected the STM32 DAC and the potentiometer is connected to the STM32 ADC.
   As the potentiometer is turned, the brightness of the LED is changed.

Device:
  -This code is built on the STM32 NUCLEO-F746ZG, this code should work for other 
   STM32s but the pin configurations may be different. Not all STM32s contain a 
   built in DAC which is required in this project. This project uses the ADC and
   the DAC.
